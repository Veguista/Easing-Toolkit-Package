# Known Issues

A list of all known recorded issues which may impact the use of the tool, together with their reported state.

1. [NOT GOING TO FIX] 
The Inspector UI does not visually reflect changes made through code to the Axes configuration.

2. [UNDER CONSIDERATION] 
Using the SecondOrderTransform applied to the Scale of a GameObject, when using parameters that induce a high deviation from the target scale, the eased scaled value can cross the negative threshold, inverting the object.
